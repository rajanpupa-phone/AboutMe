# About Me

Audacity project focusing on layouts and styling of android Layouts.


### What did we learn

- Create Layouts using android studio (Linear, Constraint )
- set gravity, orientation (vertical, horizontal)
- Add Views (Text view, ImageView, ScroolView etc) in the layout and edit properties of view
    - change font
    - text size (dp, sp) (sp is with users zoom settings)
    - padding
    - margin
    - alignment
- extract styles from a view and apply to a view

### Scrool view
- Scroll view > LinearLayout, ScrollView > TextView
